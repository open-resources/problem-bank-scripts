However, an important factor is whether the Internet retailers actually have the textbooks that students need in stock.  Students need to be able to get textbooks promptly at the beginning of the college term. If the book is not available, then a student would not be able to get the textbook at all, or might get a delayed delivery if the book is back ordered.Martin, a college newspaper reporter, is investigating textbook availability at online retailers. He decides to investigate one textbook for each of the following seven subjects: calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, statistics, geology, and general engineering. He consults textbook industry sales data and selects the most popular nationally used textbook in each of these subjects. He visits websites for a random sample of major online textbook sellers and looks up each of these seven textbooks to see if they are available in stock for quick delivery through these retailers. Based on his investigation, Martin writes an article in which he draws conclusions about the overall availability of all college textbooks through online textbook retailers.Write an analysis of his study that addresses the following issues: Is his sample representative of the population of all college textbooks?  Explain why or why not.  Describe some possible sources of bias in this study, and how it might affect the results of the study. Give some suggestions about what could be done to improve the study.",

So my favorite and main staple food is macaroni and cheese. It's high in taste and low in cost and nutritional value.One day, as I sat down to determine the meaning of life, I got a serious craving for this, oh, so important, food of my life. So I went down the street to Greatway to get a box of macaroni and cheese, but it was SO expensive! $2.02 !!! Can you believe it? It made me stop and think. The world is changing fast. I had thought that the mean cost of a box (the normal size, not some super-gigantic-family-value-pack) was at most $1, but now I wasn't so sure. However, I was determined to find out. I went to 53 of the closest grocery stores and surveyed the prices of macaroni and cheese. Here are the data I wrote in my notebook:Price per box of Mac and Cheese:\n5 stores @ $2.02\n15 stores @ $0.25\n3 stores @ $1.29\n6 stores @ $0.35\n4 stores @ $2.27\n7 stores @ $1.50\n5 stores @ $1.89\n8 stores @ 0.75.I could see that the cost varied but I had to sit down to figure out whether or not I was right. If it does turn out that this mouth-watering dish is at most $1, then I'll throw a big cheesy party in our next statistics lab, with enough macaroni and cheese for just me. (After all, as a poor starving student I can't be expected to feed our class of animals!)",

Horatio is seated at the large table at right stage.)POLONIUS: My Lord, how cans't thou admit that thou hast seen a ghost! It is but a figment of your imagination!HAMLET: I beg to differ; I know of a certainty that five-and-seventy in one hundred of us, condemned to the whips and scorns of time as we are, have gazed upon a spirit of health, or goblin damn'd, be their intents wicked or charitable.POLONIUS If thou doest insist upon thy wretched vision then let me invest your time; be true to thy work and speak to me through the reason of the null and alternate hypotheses. (He turns to Horatio.) Did not Hamlet himself say, \"What piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties? Then let not this foolishness persist. Go, Horatio, make a survey of three-and-sixty and discover what the true proportion be. For my part, I will never succumb to this fantasy, but deem man to be devoid of all reason should thy proposal of at least five-and-seventy in one hundred hold true.HORATIO (to Hamlet): What should we do, my Lord?HAMLET: Go to thy purpose, Horatio.HORATIO: To what end, my Lord?HAMLET: That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonance of our youth, but the obligation of our ever-preserved love, be even and direct with me, whether I am right or no.(Horatio exits, followed by Polonius, leaving Hamlet to ponder alone.)Act II(The next day, Hamlet awaits anxiously the presence of his friend, Horatio. Polonius enters and places some books upon the table just a moment before Horatio enters.)POLONIUS: So, Horatio, what is it thou didst reveal through thy deliberations?HORATIO: In a random survey, for which purpose thou thyself sent me forth, I did discover that one-and-forty believe fervently that the spirits of the dead walk with us. Before my God, I might not this believe, without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes.POLONIUS: Give thine own thoughts no tongue, Horatio. (Polonius turns to Hamlet.) But look to't I charge you, my Lord. Come Horatio, let us go together, for this is not our test. (Horatio and Polonius leave together.)HAMLET: To reject, or not reject, that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous statistics, or to take arms against a sea of data, and, by opposing, end them.

Ironically, I work for a company that sells products with known problems. Unfortunately, most of the problems are difficult to create, which makes them difficult to fix. I usually use the test program X, which tests the product, to try to create a specific problem. When the test program is run to make an error occur, the likelihood of generating an error is 1%.So, armed with this knowledge, I wrote a new test program Y that will generate the same error that test program X creates, but more often. To find out if my test program is better than the original, so that I can convince the management that I'm right, I ran my test program to find out how often I can generate the same error. When I ran my test program 50 times, I generated the error twice. While this may not seem much better, I think that I can convince the management to use my test program instead of the original test program. Am I right?",

Parents would name their daughters with \"ko\" attaching to other Chinese characters which have meanings that they want their daughters to become, such as Sachiko-happy child, Yoshiko-a good child, Yasuko-a healthy child, and so on.However, I noticed recently that only two out of nine of my Japanese girlfriends at this school have names which end with \"ko.\" More and more, parents seem to have become creative, modernized, and, sometimes, westernized in naming their children.I have a feeling that, while 70 percent or more of my mother's generation would have names with \"ko\" at the end, the proportion has dropped among my peers. I wrote down all my Japanese friends', ex-classmates', co-workers, and acquaintances' names that I could remember. Following are the names. (Some are repeats.)

                        "questionText": "\"To Breakfast or Not to Breakfast?\" by Richard AyoreIn the American society, birthdays are one of those days that everyone looks forward to. People of different ages and peer groups gather to mark the 18th, 20th, ..., birthdays. During this time, one looks back to see what they have achieved for the past year and also focuses ahead for more to come.If, by any chance, I am invited to one of these parties, my experience is always different. Instead of dancing around with my friends while the music is booming, I get carried away by memories of my family back home in Kenya. I remember the good times I had with my brothers and sister while we did our daily routine.Every morning, I remember we went to the shamba (garden) to weed our crops. I remember one day arguing with my brother as to why he always remained behind just to join us an hour later. In his defense, he said that he preferred waiting for breakfast before he came to weed. He said, \"This is why I always work more hours than you guys!\"And so, to prove him wrong or right, we decided to give it a try. One day we went to work as usual without breakfast, and recorded the time we could work before getting tired and stopping. On the next day, we all ate breakfast before going to work. We recorded how long we worked again before getting tired and stopping. Of interest was our mean increase in work time. Though not sure, my brother insisted that it was more than two hours. Using the data in Table 10.32, solve our problem.\n{{{ params.TABLE_GOES_HERE }}}",

It is quite effective, but persisted in the environment and over time became seen as harmful to higher-level organisms. Famously, egg shells of eagles and other raptors were believed to be thinner and prone to breakage in the nest because of ingestion of DDT in the food chain of the birds.An experiment was conducted on the number of eggs (fecundity) laid by female fruit flies.  There are three groups of flies.  One group was bred to be resistant to DDT (the RS group).  Another was bred to be especially susceptible to DDT (SS).  Finally there was a control line of non-selected or typical fruitflies (NS).  Here are the data:\n{{{ params.TABLE_GOES_HERE }}}The values are the average number of eggs laid daily for each of 75 flies (25 in each group) over the first 14 days of their lives.  Using a 1% level of significance, are the mean rates of egg selection for the three strains of fruitfly different?  If so, in what way?  Specifically, the researchers were interested in whether or not the selectively bred strains were different from the nonselected line, and whether the two selected lines were different from each other.Here is a chart of the three groups:\n<img data-media-type=\"image/png\" alt=\"This graph is a scatterplot which represents the data provided.

Many years, fans talk about some divisions being stronger (having better teams) than other divisions. This may have consequences for the postseason. For instance, in a certain year Tampa Bay won 90 games and did not play in the postseason, while Detroit won only 88 and did play in the postseason. This may have been an oddity, but is there good evidence that in this year, the American League divisions were significantly different in overall records? Use the following data to test whether the mean number of wins per team in the three American League divisions were the same or not. Note that the data are not balanced, as two divisions had five teams, while one had only four.\n{{{ params.TABLE_GOES_HERE }}}\n{{{ params.TABLE_GOES_HERE }}}\n{{{ params.TABLE_GOES_HERE }}}",
