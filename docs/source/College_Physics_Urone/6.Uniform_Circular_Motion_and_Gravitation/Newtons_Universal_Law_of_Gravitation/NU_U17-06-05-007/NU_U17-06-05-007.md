# {{ params.vars.title }} 


Calculate the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted on a ($mass_babySI) (kg) baby by a ($mass_fatherSI) (kg) father ($distance_father_babySI) (m) away at birth (he is assisting, so he is close to the child).

## Part 1 
Calculate the magnitude of the force on the baby due to Jupiter if it is at its closest distance to Earth, some ($distance_Jupiter_baby times 10^11) (m) away. Take to mass of Jupiter to be ($mass_Jupiter times 10^27) (kg). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How many times greater is the force exerted by the father on the baby compared to that exerted by Jupiter? Other objects in the room and the hospital building also exert similar gravitational forces. (Of course, there could be an unknown force acting, but scientists first need to be convinced that there is even an effect, much less that an unknown force causes it.)
