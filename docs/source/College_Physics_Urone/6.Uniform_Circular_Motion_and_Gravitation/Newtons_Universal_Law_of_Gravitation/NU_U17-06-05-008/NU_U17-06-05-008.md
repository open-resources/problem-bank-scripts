Calculate the acceleration due to gravity at Neptune due to Pluto when they are (4.50 times 10^12) (m) apart, as they are at present. Take the masses of Neptune and Pluto to be (1.024 times 10^26) (kg) and (1.309 times 10^22) (kg), respectively.

## Part 1 
Calculate the acceleration due to gravity at Neptune due to Uranus, presently about (2.50 times 10^12) (m) apart, and compare it with that due to Pluto. The mass of Uranus is (8.681 times 10^25) (kg).
