# {{ params.vars.title }} 


Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration due to the Moon's gravity at that point. Take the mass of the Moon and the distance separating the centres of the Earth and Moon to be (7.348 times 10^22) (kg) and (3.844 times 10^5) (km), respectively.

## Part 1 
Calculate the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration of the centre of Earth as it rotates about that point once each lunar month (about (27.3) days).
