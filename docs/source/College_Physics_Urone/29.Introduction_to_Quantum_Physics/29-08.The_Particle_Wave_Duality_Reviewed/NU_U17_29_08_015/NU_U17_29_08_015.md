Calculate the force per square meter of mirror.

## Part 1 
Very low mass mirrors can be constructed in the near weightlessness of space, and attached to a spaceship to sail it. Once done, the average mass per square meter of the spaceship is ($mass_per_areaSI , kg). Find the acceleration of the spaceship if all other forces are balanced.
