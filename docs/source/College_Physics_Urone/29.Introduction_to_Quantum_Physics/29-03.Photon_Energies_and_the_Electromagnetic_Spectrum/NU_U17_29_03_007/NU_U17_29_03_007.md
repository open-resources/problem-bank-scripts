How many of these photons would need to be absorbed simultaneously to ionize a molecule tightly bound by ($energy_ionize , eV)?

## Part 1 
What is the energy of a (gamma)-ray of frequency ($frequency_b times 10^20 , Hz). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How many tightly bound molecules could a single such (gamma) ray break apart?
