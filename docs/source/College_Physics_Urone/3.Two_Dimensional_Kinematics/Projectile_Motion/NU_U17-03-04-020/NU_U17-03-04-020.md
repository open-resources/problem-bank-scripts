A football quarterback is moving straight backward at a speed of ($vq,m/s) when he throws a pass to a player ($R,m) straight downfield.

## Part 1 
If the ball is thrown at an angle of ($deg^circ) relative to the ground and is caught at the same height as it is released, what is its initial speed relative to the ground? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How long does it take to get to the receiver? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
What is its maximum height above its point of release? 


 ### Answer Section
