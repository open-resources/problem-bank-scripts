Serving at a speed of ($v,km/h) a tennis player hits the ball at a height of ($h,m) and an angle (theta) below the horizontal. The baseline from which the ball is served is ($d,m) from the net, which is ($n,m) high. What is the angle  such that the ball just crosses the net?

## Part 1 
Will the ball land in the service box, which has an outermost service line (6.40,m) from the net? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Enter "yes" or "no" 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
What is the difference between the distance from the player to the net, and the distance from the player to where the ball lands?
