![Galaxies.](NU_U17-03-05-012.png)

relative to galaxy 2 and

## Part 1 
relative to galaxy 5. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
The results mean that observers on all galaxies will see themselves at the center of the expanding universe, and they would likely be aware of relative velocities, concluding that it is not possible to locate the center of expansion with the given information.
