The critical mass density needed to just halt the expansion of the universe isapproximately (10^-26)(kg/m^3).$BRa) Convert this to (eV/c^2).(m^3).$BR$BRans_rule(40) (eV/c^2).(m^3)$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$conversion"));b) Find the number of neutrinos per cubic meter needed to close the universe if their average mass is (7) (eV/c^2) and they have negligible kinetic energies.$BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BR
