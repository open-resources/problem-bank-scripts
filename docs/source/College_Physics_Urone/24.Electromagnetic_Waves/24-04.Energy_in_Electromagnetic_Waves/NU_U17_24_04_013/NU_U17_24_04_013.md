Assume the mostly infrared radiation from a heat lamp acts like a continuous wave with wavelength ($wavelength , (mu)(m).

## Part 1 
If the lamp's ($output , (W) output is focused on a person's shoulder, over a circular area ($diameter , (cm) in diameter, what is the intensity in (kW/m^2)? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What is the peak electric field strength? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
Find the peak magnetic field strength. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
How long will it take to increase the temperature of the ($mass , (kg) shoulder by ($temp^circ(C), assuming no other heat transfer and given that its specific heat is (3.47) (times 10^3) (J/kg)(^circ(C)?
