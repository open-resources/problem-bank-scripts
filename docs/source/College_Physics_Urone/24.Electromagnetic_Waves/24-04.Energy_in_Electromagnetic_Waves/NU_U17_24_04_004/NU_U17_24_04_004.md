An AM radio transmitter broadcasts ($power , (kW) of power uniformly in all directions.

## Part 1 
Assuming all of the radio waves that strike the ground are completely absorbed, and that there is no absorption by the atmosphere or other objects, what is the intensity ($distance , (km) away? (Hint: Half the power will be spread over the area of a hemisphere.) 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What is the maximum electric field strength at this distance?
