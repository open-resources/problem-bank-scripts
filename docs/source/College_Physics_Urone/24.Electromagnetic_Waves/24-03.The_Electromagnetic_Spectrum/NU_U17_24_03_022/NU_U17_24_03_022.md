Radar is used to determine distances to various objects by measuring the round-trip time for an echo from the object.

## Part 1 
How far away is the planet Venus if the echo time is ($time , (s)? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What is the echo time for a car ($distance_car , (m) from a Highway Police radar unit? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
How accurately (in nanoseconds) must you be able to measure the echo time to an airplane ($distance_plane , (km) away to determine its distance within ($range , (m)?
