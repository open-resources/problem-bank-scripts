A positron is an antimatter version of the electron, having exactly the same mass. When a positron and an electron meet, they annihilate, converting all of their mass into energy.

## Part 1 
Find the energy released, assuming negligible kinetic energy before the annihilation. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
If this energy is given to a proton in the form of kinetic energy, what is its velocity? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
If this energy is given to another electron in the form of kinetic energy, what is its velocity?
