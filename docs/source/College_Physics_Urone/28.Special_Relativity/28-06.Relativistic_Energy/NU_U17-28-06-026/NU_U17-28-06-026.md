# {{ params.vars.title }} 


Nuclear-powered rockets were researched for some years before safety concerns became paramount.

## Part 1 
What fraction of a rocket's mass would have to be destroyed to get it into a low Earth orbit, neglecting the decrease in gravity? (Assume an orbital altitude of ($radiuskm) km, and calculate both the kinetic energy (classical) and the gravitational potential energy needed.) 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
If the ship has a mass of (1.00 times 10^5) kg ((100) tons), what total yield nuclear explosion in tons of TNT is needed if it releases (4.2 times10^9, J/ton )?
