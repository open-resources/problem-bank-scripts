There is approximately (10^34) J of energy available from fusion of hydrogen in theworld's oceans.

## Part 1 
If (10^33) J of this energy were utilized, what would be the decrease in mass of the oceans? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Assume that about ($percent)% of the mass of a water molecule is converted to energy during the fusion of hydrogen. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
How great a volume of water does this correspond to?
