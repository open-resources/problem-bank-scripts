Determine the final speed, starting from rest.

## Part 1 
Determine the total time, starting from rest. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Determine the final speed, starting with an initial speed of ($vo, m/s). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
Determine the total time, starting with an initial speed of ($vo, m/s). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
Once you have obtained all of the results, it's worth reflecting on the difference in times based on the initial speeds. The difference is sufficiently small that it's not very significant in recreational skiing, but it might make a significant difference in a professional race.
