How much force is needed to compress the spring?

## Part 1 
To what maximum height can the ball be shot? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
At what angles above the horizontal may a child aim to hit a target ($R, m) away at the same height as the gun? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
larger angle = ans_rule(40) (degrees)ANS(num_cmp("$degree"));ANS(num_cmp("$degree2")); 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4
