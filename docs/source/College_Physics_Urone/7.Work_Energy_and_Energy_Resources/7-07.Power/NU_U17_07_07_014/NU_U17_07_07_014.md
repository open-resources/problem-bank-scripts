# {{ params.vars.title }} 


Part of this is absorbed and reflected by the atmosphere, so that a maximum of (1.30, kW/m^2) reaches Earth's surface. Calculate the area of solar energy collectors needed to replace an electric power plant that generates (750, MW) if the collectors convert an average of (2.00,%) of the maximum power into electricity. (This small conversion efficiency is due to the devices themselves, and the fact that the sun is directly overhead only briefly.)

## Part 1 
With the same assumptions, what area would be needed to meet the United States' energy needs (1.05 times 10^20, J/y)? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Australia's energy needs (5.4 times 10^26, J/y)? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
China's energy needs (6.3 times 10^26, J/y)?
