Suppose instead the car hits a concrete abutment at full speed and is brought to a stop in ($db, m).

## Part 1 
Calculate the magnitude of the force exerted on the car and compare it with the force found in part (a). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Ratio of second force to first force = ans_rule(40)
