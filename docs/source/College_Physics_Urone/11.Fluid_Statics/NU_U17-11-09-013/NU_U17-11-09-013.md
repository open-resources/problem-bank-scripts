To what height could such a negative gauge pressure of ($pressure , (atm) raise water? There are (1030 , (cm H)<sub>2</sub>(O) per (1 , (atm).

## Part 1 
Assume a steel wire has an initial length of (258 , (m). The density of steel is equal to (7800 , (kg/m^3) and the surface tension is equal to (2.10 times 10^11 , (N/m^2). How much would this steel wire  stretch if suspended from above?
