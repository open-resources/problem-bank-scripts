In an immersion measurement of a woman's density, she is found to have a mass of ($mass , (kg) in air and an apparent mass of ($mass2 , (kg) when completely submerged with lungs empty.

## Part 1 
What mass of water does she displace? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What is her volume? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
Calculate her density. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
If her lung capacity is (1.75 , (L), Calculate her total density. Is she able to float without treading water with her lungs filled with air? The density of air is (1.29 , (kg/m^3). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 5 
<b>Hint:</b> (If her density is less than the density of water, she will float) 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 6 
Will she float? Enter 0 for Yes or 1 for No:
