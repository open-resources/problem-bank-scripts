Bird bones have air pockets in them to reduce their weightâ€”this also gives them an average density significantly less than that of the bones of other animals. Suppose an ornithologist weighs a bird bone in air and in water and finds its mass is ($mass , (g) and its apparent mass when submerged is ($mass2 , (g) (the bone is watertight).

## Part 1 
What mass of water is displaced? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What is the volume of the bone? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
What is its average density? 


 ### Answer Section
