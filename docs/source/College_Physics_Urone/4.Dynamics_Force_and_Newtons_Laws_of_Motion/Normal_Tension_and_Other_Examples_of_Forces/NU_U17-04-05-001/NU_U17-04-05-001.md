Two teams of nine members each engage in a tug of war. Each of the first team's members has an average mass of ($t1 , kg) and exerts an average force of ($f1 , N) horizontally. Each of the second team's members has an average mass of ($t2 , kg) and exerts an average force of ($f2 , N) horizontally.
