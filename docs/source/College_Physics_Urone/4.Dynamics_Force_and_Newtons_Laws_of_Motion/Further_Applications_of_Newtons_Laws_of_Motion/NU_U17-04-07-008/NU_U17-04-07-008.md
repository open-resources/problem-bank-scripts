<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> A ($m , kg) fireworks shell is fired straight up from a mortar and reaches a height of ($h , m).

## Part 1 
(a) Neglecting air resistance (a poor assumption, but we will make it for this example), calculate the shell's velocity when it leaves the mortar. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
(b) The mortar itself is a tube ($d , m) long. Calculate the average acceleration of the shell in the tube as it goes from zero to the velocity found in (a). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
(c) What is the average force exerted on the shell in the mortar? Compute the ratio of this result to the shell's weight. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
Ratio: ans_rule(40)
