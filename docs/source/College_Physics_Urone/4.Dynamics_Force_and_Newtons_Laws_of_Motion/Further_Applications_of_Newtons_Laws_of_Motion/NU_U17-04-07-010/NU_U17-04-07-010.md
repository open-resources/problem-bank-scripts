<b>Integrated Concepts:</b> An elevator filled with passengers has a mass of ($m , kg).

## Part 1 
(a) The elevator accelerates upward from rest at a rate of ($a , m/s^2) for ($t , s). Calculate the tension in the cable supporting the elevator. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
(b) The elevator continues upward at constant velocity for (8.50 , s). What is the tension in the cable during this time? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
(c) The elevator decelerates at a rate of ($d , m/s^2) for ($t2 , s). What is the tension in the cable during deceleration? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
(d) How high has the elevator moved above its original starting point? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 5 
(e) What is its final velocity? 


 ### Answer Section
['m/s']
