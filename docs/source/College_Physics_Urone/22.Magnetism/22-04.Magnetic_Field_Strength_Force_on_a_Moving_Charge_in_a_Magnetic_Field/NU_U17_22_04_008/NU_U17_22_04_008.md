Aircraft sometimes acquire small static charges. Suppose a supersonic jet has a ($charge) Î¼(C) charge and flies due west at a speed of ($speed , (m/s) over the Earth's south magnetic pole, where the ($T) (times 10^-5 , (T) magnetic field points straight up. What is the magnitude of the magnetic force on the plane?
