Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration starting from rest if each dog exerts an average force of ($fa) (N) backward on the snow.

## Part 1 
What is the magnitude of the acceleration once the sled starts to move? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Calculate the magnitude of the force in the coupling between the dogs and the sled for the first situation. 


 ### Answer Section
