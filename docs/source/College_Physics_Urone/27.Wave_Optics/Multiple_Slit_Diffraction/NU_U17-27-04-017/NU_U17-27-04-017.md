# {{ params.vars.title }} 


(a) Show that a (30,000)-line-per-centimeter grating will not produce a maximum for visible light.

## Part 1 
(b) What is the longest wavelength for which it does produce a first-order maximum? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
(c) What is the greatest number of lines per centimeter a diffraction grating can have and produce a complete second-order spectrum for visible light? (The longest wavelength of visible light is (760 , (nm)).
