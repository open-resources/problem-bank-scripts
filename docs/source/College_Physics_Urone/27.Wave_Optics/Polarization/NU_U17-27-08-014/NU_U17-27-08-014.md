If (x) is Brewster's angle for light reflected from the top of an interface between two substances, and (y) is Brewster's angle for light reflected from below, prove that (x) + (y) = (90.0^circ).

## Part 1 
Use (n) to represent (n)<sub>1</sub>, and use (N) to represent (n)<sub>2</sub> 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
(tan(x)) = ans_rule(40) 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
(tan(y)) = ans_rule(40) 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
Using trigonometric identities to equate the two expressions above; 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 5 
(tan(x)) = ans_rule(40) 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 6 
In terms of (y), angle (x) equals ans_rule(40) 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 7 
Therefore, (x) + (y) equal ans_rule(40)
