![Forces on Arm](NU_U17_09_06_011.png)

How much is the rope stretched (past equilibrium) to provide the same force as the book? Assume the rope is held in the hand at the same location as the book.

## Part 1 
What force is on the biceps muscle if the exercise rope is pulled straight up so that the forearm makes an angle of ($angle ^circ) with the horizontal? Assume the biceps muscle is still perpendicular to the forearm.
