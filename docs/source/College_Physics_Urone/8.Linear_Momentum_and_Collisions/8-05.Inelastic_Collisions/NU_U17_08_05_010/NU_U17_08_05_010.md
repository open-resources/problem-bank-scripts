At what speed does the Moon recoil after the perfectly inelastic collision, given that the mass of the Moon is (7.36 times 10^22 , kg)?

## Part 1 
How much kinetic energy is lost in the collision? Such an event may have been observed by medieval English monks who reported observing a red glow and subsequent haze about the Moon.
