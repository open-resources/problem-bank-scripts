<b>Professional Application:</b> A ($m1 -kg) football player running at ($v1 , m/s) catches a ($m2 -kg) football having a speed of ($v2 , m/s). Calculate:

## Part 1 
the final velocity if the ball and player are going in the same direction and 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
the loss of kinetic energy in this case. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
Repeat part (a) for the situation in which the ball and the player are going in opposite directions. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
Repeat part (b) for the situation in which the ball and the player are going in opposite directions. Might the loss of kinetic energy be related to how much it hurts to catch the pass?
