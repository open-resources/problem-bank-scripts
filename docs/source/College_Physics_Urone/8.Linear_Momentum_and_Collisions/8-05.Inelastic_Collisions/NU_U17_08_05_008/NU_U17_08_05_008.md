Calculate the recoil velocity of the rifle if it is held loosely away from the shoulder.

## Part 1 
How much kinetic energy does the rifle gain? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What is the recoil velocity if the rifle is held tightly against the shoulder, making the effective mass ($m1c , kg)? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
How much kinetic energy is transferred to the rifle-shoulder combination? The pain is related to the amount of kinetic energy, which is significantly less in this latter situation.
