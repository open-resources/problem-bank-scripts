$BR$BR<b>If you do not answer this question correctly in $showHint attempts, you can get a hint.</b>$BR$BR<b>Unreasonable Results:</b> An automobile mechanic claims that an aluminum rod fits loosely into its hole on an aluminum engine block because the engine is hot and the rod is cold. If the hole is (10.0)(%) bigger in diameter than the ($temp^circC) rod, at what temperature will the rod be the same size as the hole? The coefficient of linear expansion of aluminum is equal to (2.5 times 10^-5)(^circC^-1).
