During a very quick stop, a car decelerates at ($acceleration1 m/s^2).

## Part 1 
What is the angular acceleration of its ($radius)-m-radius tires, assuming they do not slip on the pavement? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How many revolutions do the tires make before coming to rest, given their initialangular velocity is ($angularvelocity) rad/s? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
How long does the car take to stop completely? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
What distance does the car travel in this time? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 5 
What was the car's initial velocity?
