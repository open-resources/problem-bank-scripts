![Skater with Ball.](NU_U17_10_06_004.png)

Calculate the final linear velocity of the person, given his mass is ($MassPerson) kg.

## Part 1 
What is his angular velocity if each arm is ($massarm) kg? You may treat his arms as uniform rods (each has a length of ($length) m) and the rest of his body as a uniform cylinder of radius ($radiusb) m. Neglect the effect of the ball on his centre of mass so that his centre of mass remains in his geometrical centre. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Compare the initial kinetic energy and final kinetic energy by calculating both and inputting the final kinetic energy
