![Merry-go-round.](NU_U17_10_03_001.png)

How long does it take the father to give the merry-go-round and his 18.0-kg child an angular velocity of ($angularvelocity) rad/s?

## Part 1 
How many revolutions must he go through to generate this velocity? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
If he exerts a slowing force of the same magnitude, how long would it take him to stop them?
