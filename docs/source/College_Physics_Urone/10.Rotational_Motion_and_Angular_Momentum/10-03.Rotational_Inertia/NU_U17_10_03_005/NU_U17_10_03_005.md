Suppose you exert a force of ($Force) N tangential to a ($radius)-m-radius ($mass)-kg grindstone (a solid disk).

## Part 1 
What torque is exerted? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What is the angular acceleration assuming negligible opposing friction? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
What is the angular acceleration if there is an opposing frictional force of ($ForceC) N exerted ($radiusC) cm from the axis? 


 ### Answer Section
