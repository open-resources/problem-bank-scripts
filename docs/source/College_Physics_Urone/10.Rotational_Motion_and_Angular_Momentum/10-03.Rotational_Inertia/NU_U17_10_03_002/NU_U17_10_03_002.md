Calculate the moment of inertia of a skater given the following information.

## Part 1 
The ($massa)-kg skater is approximated as a cylinder that has a ($radiusa)-m radius. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
The skater with arms extended is approximately a cylinder that is ($mass2) kg, has a ($radiusa)-m radius, and has two ($radius2)-m-long arms which are ($mass3) kg each and extend straight out from the cylinder like rods rotated about their ends. 


 ### Answer Section
