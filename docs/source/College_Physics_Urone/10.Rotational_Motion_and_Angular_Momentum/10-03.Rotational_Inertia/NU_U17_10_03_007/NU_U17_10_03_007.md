# {{ params.vars.title }} 


Zorch, an archenemy of Superman, decides to slow Earth's rotation to once per (28.0) h by exerting an opposing force at and parallel to the equator. Superman is not immediately concerned, because he knows Zorch can only exert a force of (4.00 times 10^7) N (a little greater than a Saturn V rocket's thrust). How long must Zorch push with this force to accomplish his goal? (This period gives Superman time to devote to other villains.)
