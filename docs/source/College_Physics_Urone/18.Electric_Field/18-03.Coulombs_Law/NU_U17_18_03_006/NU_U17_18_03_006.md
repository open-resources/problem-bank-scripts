# {{ params.vars.title }} 


If two equal charges each of ($q1) C each are separated in air by a distance of ($c) km, what is the magnitude of the force acting between them?

## Part 1 
You will see that even at a distance as large as ($c) km, the repulsive force is substantial because ($q1) C is a very significant amount of charge.
