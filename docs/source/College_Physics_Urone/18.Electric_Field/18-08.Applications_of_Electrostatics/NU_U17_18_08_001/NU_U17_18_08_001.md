What is the electric field ($r) m from the centre of the terminal of a Van de Graaff with a ($q1) mC charge, noting that the field is equivalent to that of a ($q2,muC) charge at the centre of the terminal?

## Part 1 
At this distance, what force does the field exert on a ($q2) Î¼C charge on the Van de Graaff's belt?
