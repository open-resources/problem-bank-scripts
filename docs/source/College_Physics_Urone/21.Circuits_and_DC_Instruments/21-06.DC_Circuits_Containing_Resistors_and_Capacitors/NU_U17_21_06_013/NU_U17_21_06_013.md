Find the time constant.

## Part 1 
Calculate the temperature increase of the resistor, given that its mass is ($mass) g and its specific heat is ($heatcap) (frackJkg(^circC) noting that most of the thermal energy is retained in the short time of the discharge. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Calculate the new resistance, assuming it is pure carbon.
