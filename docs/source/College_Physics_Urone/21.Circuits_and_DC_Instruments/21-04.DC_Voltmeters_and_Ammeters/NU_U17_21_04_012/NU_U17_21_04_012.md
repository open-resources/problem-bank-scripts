What is the resistance of the combination?

## Part 1 
If the voltage across the combination is kept the same as it was across the ($resistor)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> resistor alone, what is the percent increase in current? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
If the current through the combination is kept the same as it was through the ($resistor)-<span style="font-family: 'Times'; font-size: 20px";>k&Omega;</span> resistor alone, what is the percentage decrease in voltage?
