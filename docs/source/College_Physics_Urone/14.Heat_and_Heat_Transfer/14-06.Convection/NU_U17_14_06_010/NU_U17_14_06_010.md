What is the temperature of the bottom of the pot, if it is ($dmm) (W) thick and the inside temperature is ($T1 ^circC)?

## Part 1 
If the temperature of the coffee remains constant and all of the heat transfer is removed by evaporation, how many grams per minute evaporate? Take the heat of vaporization to be ($Lv) (kJ/kg).
