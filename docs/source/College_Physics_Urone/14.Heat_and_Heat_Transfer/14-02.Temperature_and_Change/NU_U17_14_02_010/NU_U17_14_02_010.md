![Nuclear Reactor.](NU_U17_14_02_010.png)

Calculate the rate of temperature increase in degrees Celsius per second ((^circC)(/s)) if the mass of the reactor core is (1.60 times 10^5) (kg) and it has an average specific heat of (0.3349) (kJ/kg ^circC).

## Part 1 
How long would it take to obtain a temperature increase of ($increase ^circC), which could cause some metals holding the radioactive materials to melt?(The initial rate of temperature increase would be greater than that calculated herebecause the heat transfer is concentrated in a smaller mass. Later, however, thetemperature increase would slow down because the (5.00 times 10^5) (kg) steel containment vessel would also begin to heat up.)
