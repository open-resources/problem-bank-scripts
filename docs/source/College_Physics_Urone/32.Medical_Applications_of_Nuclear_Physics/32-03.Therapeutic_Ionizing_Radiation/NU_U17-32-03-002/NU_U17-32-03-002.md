If the average molecular mass of compounds in food is ($massag) g, how many molecules are there in ($massakg) kg of food?

## Part 1 
How many ion pairs are created in (1.00) kg of food, if it is exposed to (1000) Sv and it takes ($eV) eV to create an ion pair? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Find the ratio of ion pairs to molecules. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
If these ion pairs recombine into a distribution of ($denom) new compounds, how many parts per billion is each?
