Integrated Concepts The laser system tested for inertial confinement can produce a ($EnergykJ)-kJ pulse only ($timens) ns in duration. $BRa) What is the power output of the laser system during the brief pulse?$BR$BRans_rule(40) W$BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$Power"));b) How many photons are in the pulse, given their wavelength is ($um) Î¼m ? $BR$BRans_rule(40) $BR$BRANS(num_cmp("$ratio"));c) What is the total momentum of all these photons?  $BR$BRans_rule(40) kg m/s$BR$BR
