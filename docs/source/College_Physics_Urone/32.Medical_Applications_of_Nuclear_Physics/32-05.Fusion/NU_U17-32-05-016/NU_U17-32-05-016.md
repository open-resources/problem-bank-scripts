Integrated Concepts $BRa) What temperature gas would have atoms moving fast enough to bring two (^3)He nuclei into contact? Note that, because both are moving, the average kinetic energy only needs to be half the electric potential energy of these doubly charged nuclei when just in contact with one another. $BR$BRans_rule(40) K$BR$BR
