![Tethered Satellite](NU_U17_23_03_010.png)

How much does the cable stretch if a ($forceSI) (N) force is exerted to pull the satellite in? (Assume the satellite and shuttle are at the same altitude above the Earth.)

## Part 1 
What is the effective force constant of the cable? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How much energy is stored in it when stretched by the ($forceSI) (N) force?
