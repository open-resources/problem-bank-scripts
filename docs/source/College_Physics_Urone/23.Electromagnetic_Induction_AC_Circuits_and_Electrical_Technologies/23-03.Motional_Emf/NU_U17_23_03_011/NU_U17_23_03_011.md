What magnetic drag force does this produce if the system is moving at ($speed) (km/s)?

## Part 1 
How much kinetic energy is removed from the system in ($time) (h), neglecting any change in altitude or velocity during that time? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What is the change in velocity if the mass of the system is ($massSI) (kg)?
