At full energy, protons in the ($diameter , (km) diameter Fermilab synchrotron travel at nearlythe speed of light, since their energy is about (1000) times their rest mass energy.

## Part 1 
How long does it take for a proton to complete one trip around? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How many times per second will it pass through the target area?
