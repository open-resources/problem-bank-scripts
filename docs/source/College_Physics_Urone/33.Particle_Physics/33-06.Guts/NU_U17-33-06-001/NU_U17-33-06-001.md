The intensity of cosmic ray radiation decreases rapidly with increasing energy, but there are occasionally extremely energetic cosmic rays that create a shower of radiation from all the particles they create by striking a nucleus in the atmosphere as seen in the figure given below. Suppose a cosmic ray particle having an energy of (10^10 , (GeV) converts its energy into particles with masses averaging ($MeV) (GeV/c^2).

## Part 1 
How many particles are created? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
If the particles rain down on a ($Area) (km^2) area, how many particles are there per square meter? 


 ### Answer Section
