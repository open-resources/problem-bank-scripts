Calculate the relativistic quantity (gamma) = (1)/((1)-(v)<sup>2</sup>/(c)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> for ($TeV , (TeV) protons produced at Fermilab.

## Part 1 
If such a proton created a (pi^+) having the same speed, how long would its life be in the laboratory? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How far could it travel in this time?
