# {{ params.vars.title }} 


The mass of a theoretical particle that may be associated with the unification of theelectroweak and strong forces is (10^14) (GeV/c^2).

## Part 1 
How many proton masses is this? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How many electron masses is this? (This indicates how extremely relativistic theaccelerator would have to be in order to make the particle, and how large therelativistic quantity (gamma) would have to be.)
