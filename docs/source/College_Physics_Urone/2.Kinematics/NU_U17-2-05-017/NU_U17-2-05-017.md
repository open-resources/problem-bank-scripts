# {{ params.vars.title }} 


An express train passes through a station. It enters with an initial velocity of ($v , (m/s) and decelerates at a rate of ($a , (m/s^2) as it goes through. The station is (200 , (m) long.

## Part 1 
How long is the nose of the train in the station? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How fast is it going when the nose leaves the station? 


 ### Answer Section
