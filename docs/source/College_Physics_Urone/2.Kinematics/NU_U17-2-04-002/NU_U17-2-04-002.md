Dr. John Paul Stapp was U.S. Air Force officer who studied the effects of extreme deceleration on the human body. On December 10, 1954, Stapp rode a rocket sled, accelerating from rest to a top speed of (282 m/s) ((1015 km/h)) in (5.00 s), and was brought jarringly back to rest in only (1.40 s)! Calculate the magnitude of his (a) acceleration as he sped up and (b) acceleration as he slowed down. Express each in multiples of (g) ((9.80 m/s^2)) by taking its ratio to the acceleration of gravity.
