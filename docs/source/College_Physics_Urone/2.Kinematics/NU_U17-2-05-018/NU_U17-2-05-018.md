A dragster can reach a top speed of ($V , (m/s) in only ($T , (s).

## Part 1 
Calculate the average acceleration for such a dragster. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Find the final velocity of this dragster starting from rest and accelerating at the rate found in (a) for (402 , (m) (a quarter mile) without using any information on time. Assume a constant acceleration. Note this is not valid for a dragster, which would reach a terminal speed in actuality.
