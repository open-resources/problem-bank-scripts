The ceramic glaze on a red-orange Fiestaware plate is(:U_2 O_3) and contains ($mass , g) of(:^2 3 8U), but very little(:^2 3 5U).

## Part 1 
What is the activity of the plate? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Calculate the total energy that will be released by the(:^2 3 8U) decay. The energy released per decay is(:$decay , MeV). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
If energy is worth ($cents) cents per (kW cdot (h), what is the monetary value of the energy emitted? (These plates went out of production some thirty years ago, but are still available as collectibles.)
