 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
The purpose of this problem is to show in three ways that the binding energy of the electron in a hydrogen atom is negligible compared with the masses of the proton and electron. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
Calculate the mass equivalent of the ($binding_energy , eV) binding energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
Subtract the mass of a proton from the mass of a hydrogen atom. You will find the difference is equal to the electron's mass to three digits, implying the binding energy is small in comparison. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 5 
Take the ratio of the binding energy of the electron, ($binding_energy , eV), to the energy equivalent of the electron's mass.
