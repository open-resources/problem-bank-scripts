The applied voltage sweeps the ions out of the gas in ($time) Î¼s. What is the current?

## Part 1 
BEGIN_HINTPerhaps using dimensional analysis, can you first express the average current in terms of: 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
<b>i.</b> the charge on the ions created, and 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
<b>ii.</b> the number of ions created each second? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
Furthermore, remember that, in calculating <b>ii.</b>, you are told what energy is consumed by an ion <i>pair</i>.END_HINTANS(num_cmp("$current_a")); 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 5 
This current is smaller than the actual current since the applied voltage in the Geiger tube accelerates the separated ions, which then create other ion pairs in subsequent collisions. What is the current if this last effect multiplies the number of ion pairs by(,$m)?
