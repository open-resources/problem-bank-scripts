Calculate the resistance of the hose.

## Part 1 
What is the viscosity of the concrete, assuming the flow is laminar? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How much power is being supplied, assuming the point of use is at the same level as the pump? You may neglect the power supplied to increase the concrete's velocity.
