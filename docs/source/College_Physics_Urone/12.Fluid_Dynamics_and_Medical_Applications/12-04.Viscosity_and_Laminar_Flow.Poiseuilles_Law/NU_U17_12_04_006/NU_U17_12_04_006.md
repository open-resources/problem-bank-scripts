Pressure difference increases by a factor of (1.50).

## Part 1 
A new fluid with (3.00) times greater viscosity is substituted. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
The tube is replaced by one having (4.00) times the length. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
Another tube is used with a radius (0.100) times the original. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 4 
Yet another tube is substituted with a radius (0.100) times the original and half the length, and the pressure difference is increased by a factor of (1.50). 


 ### Answer Section
