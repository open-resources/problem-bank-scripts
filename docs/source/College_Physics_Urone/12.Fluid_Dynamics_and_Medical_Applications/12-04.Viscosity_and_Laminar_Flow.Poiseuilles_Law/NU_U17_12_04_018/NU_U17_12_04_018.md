What pressure is now being supplied to the house, assuming resistance is constant?

## Part 1 
By what factor did the flow rate in the water main increase in order to cause this decrease in pressure delivered to the house? The pressure at the entrance of the water main is ($pressure3 times 10^5) (N/m^2), and the original flow rate was ($QmLmin) (L/min). 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How many more users are there, assuming each would consume ($Qha) (L/min) in the morning and ($Qh1a) (L/min) in the afternoon?
