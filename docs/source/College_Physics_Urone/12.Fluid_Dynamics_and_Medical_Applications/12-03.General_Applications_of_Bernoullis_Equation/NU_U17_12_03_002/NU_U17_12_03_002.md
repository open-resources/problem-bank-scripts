# {{ params.vars.title }} 


At takeoff, an aircraft travels at ($va) (m/s), so that the air speed relative to the bottom of the wing is ($va) (m/s). Taking the sea level density of air to be ($p) (kg/m^3), how fast must it move over the upper surface to create the ideal lift?

## Part 1 
How fast must air move over the upper surface at a cruising speed of ($vb) (m/s) and at an altitude where air density is one-fourth that at sea level? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Note that this is not all of the aircraft's liftâ€”some comes from the body of the plane, some from engine thrust, and so on. Furthermore, Bernoulli's principle gives an approximate answer because flow over the wing creates turbulence.
