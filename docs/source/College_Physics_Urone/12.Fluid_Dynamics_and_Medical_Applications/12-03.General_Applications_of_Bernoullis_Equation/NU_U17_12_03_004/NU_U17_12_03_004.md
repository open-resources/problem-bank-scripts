# {{ params.vars.title }} 


The water enters a hose with a ($d1)-(cm) inside diameter and rises ($ha) (m) above the pump. What is its pressure at this point?

## Part 1 
The hose goes over the foundation wall, losing (0.500) (m) in height, and widens to ($d2) (cm) in diameter. What is the pressure now? You may neglect frictional losses in both parts of the problem.
