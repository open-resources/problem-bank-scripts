What is the speed of the blood flow? (This small speed allows time for diffusion of materials to and from the blood).

## Part 1 
Assuming all the blood in the body passes through capillaries, how many of them must there be to carry a total flow of ($totalflow) (cm^3)(/s)? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
(The large number obtained is an overestimate, but it is still reasonable).
