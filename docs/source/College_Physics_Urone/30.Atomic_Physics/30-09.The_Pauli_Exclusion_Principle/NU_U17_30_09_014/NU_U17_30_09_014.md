In a laboratory experiment designed to duplicate Thomson's determination of (q_e/m_e) , a beam of electrons having a velocity of ($velocity) (times 10^7 , (m/s) enters a ($strength) (times 10^-3 , (T) magnetic field. The beam moves perpendicular to the field in a path having a ($radius , (cm) radius of curvature. Determine (q_e/m_e) from these observations.
