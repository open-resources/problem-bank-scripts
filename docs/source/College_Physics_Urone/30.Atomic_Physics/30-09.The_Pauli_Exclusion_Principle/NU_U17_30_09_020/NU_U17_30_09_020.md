# {{ params.vars.title }} 


An excimer laser used for vision correction emits ($wavelength , (nm) UV. Calculate the photon energy in (eV).

## Part 1 
These photons are used to evaporate corneal tissue, which is very similar to water in its properties. Calculate the amount of energy needed per molecule of water to make the phase change from liquid to gas. That is, divide the heat of vaporization in (kJ/kg) by the number of water molecules in a kilogram. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Convert this to (eV).
