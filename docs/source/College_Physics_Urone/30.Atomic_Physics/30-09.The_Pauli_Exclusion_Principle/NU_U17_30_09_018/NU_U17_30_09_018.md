A carbon dioxide laser used in surgery emits infrared radiation with a wavelength of ($wavelength) (mu(m). In ($time , (ms), this laser raised the temperature of ($area) (cm^3) of flesh to (100^circ)(C) and evaporated it (assume body temperature is (37^circ(C)).

## Part 1 
How many photons were required? You may assume flesh has the same heat of vaporization as water. 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
What was the minimum power output during the flash?
