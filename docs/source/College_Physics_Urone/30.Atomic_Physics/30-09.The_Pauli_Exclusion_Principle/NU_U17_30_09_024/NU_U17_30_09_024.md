# {{ params.vars.title }} 


A student in a physics laboratory observes a hydrogen spectrum with a diffraction grating for the purpose of measuring the wavelengths of the emitted radiation. In the spectrum, she observes a yellow line and finds its wavelength to be ($wavelength , (nm).

## Part 1 
Assuming this is part of the Balmer series, determine (n)<sub>i</sub>, the principal quantum number of the initial state.
