In Millikan's oil-drop experiment, one looks at a small oil drop held motionless between two plates. Take the voltage between the plates to be ($voltage , (V), and the plate separation to be ($separation , (cm). The oil drop (of density ($density, (g/cm^3)) has a diameter of ($diameter) (times 10^-6 , (m). Find the charge on the drop, in terms of electron units.
