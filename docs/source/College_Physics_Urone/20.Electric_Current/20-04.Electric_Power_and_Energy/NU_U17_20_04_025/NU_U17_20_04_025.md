# {{ params.vars.title }} 


Assuming ($eff , (%) efficiency for the conversion of electrical power by the motor, what current must the ($volt , (V) batteries of a ($mass , (kg) electric car be able to supply:

## Part 1 
To accelerate from rest to ($Va , (m/s) in ($ta , (min)? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
To climb a ($h) (times 10^2 , (m) high hill in ($tb , (min) at a constant ($Vb , (m/s) speed while exerting ($Nb) (times 10^2 , (N) of force to overcome air resistance and friction? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
To travel at a constant ($Vc , (m/s) speed, exerting a ($Nc) (times 10^2 , (N) force to overcome air resistance and friction?
