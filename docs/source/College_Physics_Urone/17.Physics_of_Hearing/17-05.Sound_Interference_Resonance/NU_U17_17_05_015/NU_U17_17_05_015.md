Students in a physics lab are asked to find the length of an air column in a tubeclosed at one end that has a fundamental frequency of ($f1 , (Hz). They hold the tubevertically and fill it with water to the top, then lower the water while a ($f1 , (Hz) tuningfork is rung and listen for the first resonance. What is the air temperature if theresonance occurs for a length of ($L , (m)?

## Part 1 
At what length will they observe the second resonance (first overtone)?
