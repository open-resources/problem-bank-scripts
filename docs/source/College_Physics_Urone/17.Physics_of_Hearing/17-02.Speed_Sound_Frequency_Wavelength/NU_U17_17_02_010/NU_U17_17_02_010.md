A physicist at a fireworks display times the lag between seeing an explosion and hearing its sound, and finds it to be ($t , (s).

## Part 1 
How far away is the explosion if air temperature is ($TC ^circ(C) and if you neglect the time taken for light to reach the physicist? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
Calculate the distance to the explosion taking the speed of light into account. Note that this distance is negligibly greater.
