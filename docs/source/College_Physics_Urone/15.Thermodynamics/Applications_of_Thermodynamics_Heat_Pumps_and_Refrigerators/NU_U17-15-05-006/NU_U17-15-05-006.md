# {{ params.vars.title }} 


How much work in joules must be done for a heat transfer of ($heat) (kJ) from the cold environment? There are (4186) (J/kcal).

## Part 1 
What is the cost of doing this if the work costs (10.0) cents per (3.60 times 10^6) (J) (a kilowatt-hour)? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
How many (kJ) of heat transfer occurs into the warm environment?
