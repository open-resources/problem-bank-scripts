# {{ params.vars.title }} 


Find the work done by the steam when the piston moves ($distance) (m). Note that this is the net work output, since gauge pressure is used.

## Part 1 
Now find the amount of work by calculating the force exerted times the distance traveled. Is the answer the same as in part (a)?
