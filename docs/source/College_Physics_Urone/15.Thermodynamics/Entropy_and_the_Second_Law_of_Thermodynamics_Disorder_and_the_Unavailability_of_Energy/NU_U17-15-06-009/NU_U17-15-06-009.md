Calculate the heat transfer to the power station in one day.

## Part 1 
How much heat transfer occurs to the environment in one day? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 2 
If the heat transfer in the cooling towers is from ($tempwater^circC) water into the local air mass, which increases in temperature from ($templow^circC) to ($temphigh^circC), what is the total increase in entropy due to this heat transfer? 


 ### Answer Section

## Part 3 
How much energy becomes unavailable to do work because of this increase in entropy, assuming a ($templow^circC) lowest temperature?
